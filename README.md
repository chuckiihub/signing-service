# Signature Service - Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Mat√≠as. I have to say that I've actually enjoyed doing the code challenge. In my last job I was working with Java and it was in my previous job that I worked with Go for a year. I have to say that I love the language, so, this has been fun and I would love to keep studying and improve with better Go best practices from here on.

Thanks for the comments and good requirement explanation, those have been quite nice to have.

## Solution

The structure of the project is the following, with some explanations:

```
api/                        Represents the HTTP Transport layer.
-- dto/                         Contain the Request and Response declarations
-- validation/                  Contains the logic to setup the validation logic and "a" custom validator.

crypto/                     I've treated this directory as a library. I did some modifications to support the addition of new encryption algorithms

domain/                     Device, Signature and Health structures.

errors/apperrors.go         This is a custom error wrapper so when the error travels up in the call stack, the caller knows a bit more about the error (like http.StatusCode)

persistence/                This is basically a repository pattern. I assume we might want to store stuff in different databases so I did not enforce any DB dependency between them.

service/                    So to abstract the domain logic from the Transport Layer I build services that could be used later to add a different transport layer (websockets, gRPC)

static/docs/                Docs of the API, so you can also test it quickly. Assumes service is running on port 8081
```

### Addition of new Algorithms

Let's say that you want to add a new algorithm, you're gonna have to:

- Add a new SignatureAlgorithm constant (crypto/algorithm.go)
- Implement the Crypto interface (which uses a Generic KeyPair) (crypto/crypto.go)
- Implement the Signer interface (signer.go) and the KeyGenerator (generation.go) interface. I kept Signer interface as the challenge wanted me to implement the Signer one. TBH I would have done everything in the Crypto interface specified above.
- Watch out with the "New" methods on all those interfaces. You're gonna have to add a case to return the new Signer, KeyGenerator and Crypto.

The validation logic will grab the new algorithm and use it to validate requests. The Services will use the Crypto implementations and adapt automatically to the new algorithm.

## Extras

### Swagger docs

You can access the swagger documentation using /api/v0/docs endpoint.

### Health endpoint

The health endpoint will call each of the services' CheckHealth method and gather all the information in the Health response. This way tracking what's the problem with the service 
should be easier.

### Verify method

To check that I was doing everything alright I've implemented a verify endpoint that answers 200 if the signature is valid and 429 (I'm a Teapot) if the signature is not valid.
Improvement on the response should be done :) 

### Makefile

There's a simple Makefile where you can run the tests, compile, generate the docs.

## Things to note

### Signing data and concurrency

The requirement for the Signing functionality only specified that the Device.SignatureCounter should be handled atomically. I've implemented this with a map[uuid]RWMutex (a mutex per device) as we should also be carefull to not mess around concurrently with the LastSignature field that might be modified by many at the same time. Using a Mutex per device would improve the performance a bit as we are not locking the whole device database when we need exclusive access to a device.

I've also implemented a very simple rollback logic in the service, this could have been done in the PersistenceLayer preferably. 

### Locking Service

As horizontally scaling is generally needed I did the Locking per device (right before signing) in a separate service. Later on, if we are using an external database, this could be implemented
using, for example Redis, to have a locking functionality across different nodes/pods.

## Things I would have like to have the time to do

### Endpoint Testing

I would have liked to do Functional/Endpoint testing (httptest) so to check how the app reacts to different JSON payloads, testing the error cases and unhappy paths so to make sure that the app always works. 

### Unhappy path testing

When I'm coding I like to do a lot of error case / not happy path tests. Due to the time, I've decided to stick with showing knowledge about Mocking, unit testing, etc. As an example, not every functionality is being testedm which, I also would have liked to do.
